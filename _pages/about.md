I am an incoming PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. I will be supervised by Professor Sheila McIlraith. Prior to this, I was a Master's student at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC Chile), affiliated with the National Center for Artificial Intelligence (CENIA).

My interests mainly lie at the intersection of computer vision and deep learning. This includes self-supervised representation learning, compositional generalization, and frameworks for long-tail image generation. I am particularly interested in building AI systems that can effectively understand complex, compositional structures. You may find my list of publications here.

I was born in Santiago, Chile. I grew up in Boston, MA, and Madrid, before finally coming back to Chile to finish my schooling. Prior to my PhD, I attended PUC Chile, where I obtained my Master's degree.

Aside from my research, I will be teaching the discrete mathematics IIC1253 course at PUC during the first semester of 2026. I also actively contribute to educational open-source projects, such as creating syllabus materials for the university-level Artificial Intelligence course IIC2613.
