title: Discrete Mathematics
description: This course teaches the elements that allow formalizing statements of various engineering problems using concepts of discrete mathematics (sets, relations, functions, induction, etc.) and modeling this type of problems with these elements; additionally, graph theory is taught to represent and solve some of these types of problems, along with the formal methodology of algorithm analysis and computational complexity.

## Course Overview

By the end of the course, the student will be able to:

- Formulate formal statements in mathematical notation using logic, sets, relations, functions, cardinality, and other tools, developing definitions and theorems about them, as well as prove or refute these statements using various techniques.
- Apply induction as a technique for proving properties in discrete sets and as a technique for formal definition of discrete objects.
- Formally model a problem using sets, relations, and necessary properties, and prove properties regarding their model.
- Model a discrete problem using graphs and associated techniques, and prove properties about problems modeled as graphs.
- Formally prove that a simple algorithm works correctly, and determine the efficiency of an algorithm, developing an asymptotic notation to estimate execution time.
- Determine the relative difficulty of computational problems, basing arguments on computational complexity techniques.

## Prerequisites

- MAT1203 OR IMT2210 OR (IIC1001 AND MAT1207)

## Textbooks

- Primary: "Discrete Mathematics with Applications, 3rd ed." by Epp S., 2003.

## Grading

- The students' performance in the course is evaluated based on quizzes, assignments, and an exam.

## Methodology

Weekly Modules:
- Lectures: 2
- Teaching Assistantships: 1

The course is conducted using a student-centered teaching method; this method allows students to develop the competencies defined in the course objectives. This course is designed so that the student studies on average 6 hours per week.
